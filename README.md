# Bank Transaction Risk & Anomaly Analyzer

Small CLI tool to load, clean, feature-engineer, score and flag suspicious bank/credit-card transactions.

## Summary

This project processes transaction datasets to compute customer risk scores and flag suspicious transactions. It provides a simple menu-driven CLI (`main.py`) that walks through steps: load data, clean data, build features, compute risk scores, flag suspicious transactions, and export reports.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. From the repository root run:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use the interactive menu to:
- `1` Load dataset
- `2` Clean data
- `3` Build features
- `4` Score customers
- `5` Flag suspicious transactions
- `6` Export reports
- `7` Display a quick summary in console
- `0` Exit

Follow steps 1→5 before exporting reports (option 6).

## Included Files

- `main.py` — Menu-driven entrypoint for running the processing pipeline.
- `Dataloading.py` — Data loading helpers.
- `Datacleaning.py` — Transaction cleaning routines.
- `preparefeatures.py` — Feature engineering.
- `risk_scores.py` — Risk scoring logic.
- `TransactionFlagger.py` — Transaction flagging logic.
- `Reports.py` — Report generation utilities.
- `creditcard.csv`, `PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv` — example data files (if present).
- `flagged_transactions.csv`, `customer_risk_summary.csv` — example outputs generated by the pipeline.

## Output

Running the full pipeline (through option 5) will produce a processed dataframe assigned to `final_df` in the code and, when exporting reports (option 6), will trigger `ReportGenerator` which writes summary reports and CSVs (see `flagged_transactions.csv` and `customer_risk_summary.csv`).

## Notes & Next Steps

- If you need a `requirements.txt`, generate one via `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your virtual environment.
- To extend: add unit tests, create a CLI argument mode (non-interactive), or containerize with Docker for reproducible runs.

# 🕵️ Financial Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
Automated pipeline for identifying suspicious financial transactions using **Z-Score** and custom risk logic.

## 🛠 Methodology
* **Z-Score Analysis:** To detect statistical outliers in transaction amounts.
* **Risk Scoring:** Assigning a 0-100 score based on type and magnitude.
* **Banding:** Categorizing users into Low, Medium, High, and Critical.

## 📊 Outputs
* `flagged_transactions.csv`: List of all flagged alerts.
* `customer_risk_summary.csv`: Final risk report per customer.
